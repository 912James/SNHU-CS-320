How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is functioanl and secure I would be aware of the security requirements of the specific software or product. To check the functionality of the code i would perform the different functionality testing we learned about throughout this course. The first step to ensure functional code, software or program is by performing a requirement analysis. From there we would test plan, design test cases, define and verify the requirements and finally execute the test cases. From this course we learned the importance of having quality, error or bug free software. Having the proper test cases and JUnit tests, we could uncover functional flaws within the code, we could test the software for accuracy agaisnt the requirements and we ensure that we do not have to rework or rewrite code that ultiamtely would cost more money to the company.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The user needs were given to us as requirements in the rubric for each assignement and the course Project. Each requirement had specific details about what each tasks and service needed to accomplish. From the rubric i was able to write the code to meet the requirements and then create the JUnit tests to ensure that those details were covered and completed. 

How do I approach designing software?

The approach I took for this project was first to meet all the requirements. From there I made the neccessasry adjustments to the code to remove any unnecassary or redundant code. To improve productivity i utizied lean software developemnt techniques and ensured that the JUnit tests properly covered all the requirements that were described in the rubric.
